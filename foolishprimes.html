  <h1>Twenty-Two Foolish Primes</h1>
  <h2>A quick explanantion on Project Euler Problem 239</h2>
  <dt-byline></dt-byline>

   <p> It's been a while since anything was posted on this website. But here we are trying to get back into the groove of things. Worked
        through this problem from Project Euler yesterday despite it bringing back some traumatic combinatoric memories (probably the most
        naive way to solve it). Tried using the Distill.pub article framework and mathJAX.</p>
        <dt-byline></dt-byline>
  <p> Here's the problem statement: </p>
  <p>
          <strong>A set of disks numbered 1 through 100 are placed in a line in random order.

          What is the probability that we have a partial derangement such that exactly 22 prime number discs are found away from their natural positions?
          (Any number of non-prime disks may also be found in or out of their natural positions.)

          Give your answer rounded to 12 places behind the decimal point in the form 0.abcdefghijkl.</strong>
  </p>
<p>
  Alright sounds like some proper aids. General Problem solving tip, let's try and break the problem down into stages and look for the invariants. So a quick
  google search reveals there are 25 primes from 1 to 100. That means if exactly 22 primes must be in their position then 3 <strong> MUST </strong> be out of position.
  Alright so lets fix 3 of the 25 primes in their positions, now if we can count the permutations (of the remaining 97 numbers) where the 22 primes are out of place we are done.
  I am going to express this mathematically using a complement and unions. We designate $A_i$ as the set of all permutations where the ith prime (of the remaining 22)
is its correct place. That means the set of all permutations (of the non-fixed 97 numbers) where the 22 primes are in their <strong>correct</strong>
locations is $A_1 \bigcup A_2 \bigcup \dots \bigcup A_{22}$. This is the complement of what we are looking for so the expression we need to compute is
$97! - A_1 \bigcup A_2 \bigcup \dots \bigcup A_{22}$. The reason we express it this way is that we can invoke the inclusion-exclusion principle (if you don't know what this
is, do look it up, its motivations are very intuitive) and come up with a clean formulaic expression to express with computer code. What the I-E principle basically states is the union of multiple sets can be expressed as an alternating sum of the unions of subgroups of all the sets in question. </p>

  <p>
  <dt-code block language="python">
          from math import factorial

          def C(n,r):
          	return factorial(n) / (factorial(n-r) * factorial(r))

          def foolishprimes():
          	sample_space_size = factorial(100)
          	event_size = C(25, 3) * (factorial(97) - sum([(-1)**(i-1) * C(22, i) * factorial(97-i) for i in range(1,23)]))
          	print(round(event_size/sample_space_size,12))

          foolishprimes()
  </dt-code>
  </p>
  <p> So let me try and explain the code quickly. The sum(...) function is the I-E principle in action. The (-1) term is to induce an alternating sum. The next two terms are for finding (without loss of generality) the number of elements in for example say $A_1 \bigcup A_2 \bigcup A_3$. We then iterate
through all the possible subgroup sizes (read the wikipedia for I-E). We use 22 choose i to represent the number of ways we can pick i primes to be in the right location and factoiral(97-i) to calculate the number of permutations of the rest of the non fixed numbers.
          We multiply that value with 25 choose 3, because that
is the number of ways we can fix three primes. Do not write your own factorial function because there is no way it can handle or represent anything past n = 20. The geniuses of our time have found a way to store large numbers as digit arrays to bypass memory constraints and seamlessly allow arithmetic operations
without requiring specialized functions. Without their genius my solution would not work and would require some voodoo. If you want voodoo, attempt the hackkerank version of this problem, it requires a bunch of trick to hit the time requirments such as precomputation and dynamic programming.
